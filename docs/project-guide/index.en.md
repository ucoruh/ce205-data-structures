## Project Description

### Project Selection

Choose an application from the provided appendix. Ensure no two teams select the same application to prevent plagiarism. Teams are self-formed; projects are not pre-assigned by us. Also, if you have taken this course again do not select the same project as other courses. You will select a single project idea and you will use develop same project in C/C++, Java and Csharp with prepared project templates for you.

### Project Setup:

Fork the templates from following repositories

- C/C++ Cmake 
  
  - https://github.com/ucoruh/cpp-cmake-ctest-template
  
  - Name this repository `ce205-final-name-surname-cpp`

- Net Core Csharp 
  
  - https://github.com/ucoruh/vs-net-core-template
  
  - Name this repository `ce205-final-name-surname-csharp`

- Java Maven 
  
  - https://github.com/ucoruh/eclipse-java-maven-template
  
  - Name this repository `ce205-final-name-surname-java`

Your code must reside in a private GitHub repository, accessible only to us.

### Development:

Construct a console application where the main functionality is housed within a separate library. This console application will utilize the said library for its operations. If There is a storage operation use binary files to record data. If There is a socket communications, APIs or Integrations with Remote services generate mockups to simulate operations. Each project idea has menu tree to define operations you should complete all operations and for console menu operations use keyboard arrows or tab for option and menu selections.

### Team Collaboration:

Include your team members in the GitHub project. There should be only one project repository for each team.

### Instructor Collaboration:

Add your instructor as a collaborator on the project.

### Repository Privacy:

Maintain the privacy of your repository. Public repositories will be treated as instances of plagiarism.

### Development & Documentation:

Develop the application and its accompanying unit tests. Document both the application and the library using Doxygen.

### Template Usage:

Ensure comprehensive utilization of the provided template. The template aids in building, testing, generating documentation, measuring test and documentation coverages, and packaging essential files. Failure to adhere to the template standards will result in non-acceptance.

### Coverage Thresholds:

Achieve a minimum of 100%-unit test coverage and 100% documentation coverage for project acceptance.

### Platform Compatibility:

Ensure your application is compatible with both WSL/Linux and Windows OS.

### Coding Standards:

Pay meticulous attention to your coding style, including function and variable naming conventions.

### Presentation:

Prepare a presentation deck, with a limit of 10 slides, detailing your project.

### Video Submission:

Record a video presentation of your project. Each team member should contribute to the video, which should not exceed 4 minutes in total duration.

### Contribution Tracking:

Individual contributions will be tracked via git commits. Commit frequently to reflect your involvement accurately.

### Repository Management:

On your GitHub, ensure well-maintained README.md files, gitignore, git usage notes, collaboration ratios, and manage merges/conflict resolutions. Documentation coverage will be evaluated in your repository.

### Report Submission:

Submit a detailed report named ce205-final-name-surname.docx.

### Classroom Code Submission:

Share your code in Classroom, excluding binaries. Any binary files present will result in a penalty. Remove any superfluous
files.

### Code Understanding:

Comment on your code thoroughly, providing explanations for your logic. Only submit work you understand.

### Code Aesthetics:

Ensure your code is neatly formatted and indented for clarity.

### File Management:

Ensure correct project and file types.

### Code Quality:

Do not submit malfunctioning or bug-ridden code.

### Test Results:

Your project's test outcomes must be accurate.

#### Algorithm Explanation:

If your project involves algorithmic solutions, provide a step-by-step explanation of your methods.

### Source Code Naming:

The source code should be archived and named as ce205-final-name-surname.rar. This archive should contain the Visual Studio solution cloned from GitHub.

### Originality:

Do not replicate someone else's code. We will employ software to detect similarities. Take ownership of the provided source codes and make them uniquely yours. Strict plagiarism checks will be in place.

### Documentation Sharing:

Only share the Doxygen-generated PDF documentation. Refrain from sending any HTML or other auto-generated documentation components.

### Warning:

Relying on tools like ChatGPT for your project development or documentation is discouraged. Authenticity and originality are paramount.

### DevOps:

Csharp and Java templates should create releases.
